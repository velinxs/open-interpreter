class CwdTrackingMixin:
    """Tracks a persistent shell's working directory and strips redundant ``cd`` prefixes.

    Persistent shell subprocesses (bash, PowerShell, cmd) start in the CLI's
    working directory. LLMs habitually re-emit ``cd /the/path/i'm/already/in``
    at the top of every block — often chained with ``&&``/``;``/``&`` — which
    wastes a round trip and encourages standalone-script thinking. This mixin
    removes those prefixes when they wouldn't change the shell's location.

    The real location is learned two ways: from kept ``cd`` commands, and
    authoritatively from a ``##oi_pwd##<path>`` line the language echoes just
    before its end-of-execution marker (see ``_insert_cwd_marker``), which
    self-corrects tracking if it ever desyncs.

    Subclasses configure:
      ``cd_commands``          recognized ``cd`` spellings (PowerShell adds
                               ``Set-Location``/``sl``; default ``("cd",)``)
      ``cd_ignore_case``       case-insensitive command match (PowerShell)
      ``cd_option_prefixes``   leading option tokens to skip (cmd's ``/d``)
      ``cd_chain_operators``   chaining separators kept after a stripped cd
                               (cmd has no ``;``; default ``("&&", ";", "&")``)
