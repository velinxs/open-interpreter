    Instead of dropping the oldest single turn each call — which moves the
    truncation point every turn and breaks the provider's KV prefix cache — the
    prompt is only touched when it grows past `token_limit`, and then trimmed
    all the way down to `retention_ratio * token_limit` (0.8 by default: keep
    80% of the budget, drop the oldest 20% at once).  The truncation point then
    stays fixed for several turns while the conversation grows back toward the
    limit, giving the GPU prefix cache time to pay off on successive requests.

    Unlike the older `truncation_step` approach (drop a *fixed* token chunk), a
    *variable* number of whole messages is dropped each time and the cut is
    aligned to a safe boundary: it lands on a `user` message or on a plain
    `assistant` message with no `function_call`/`tool_calls`, so a tool call
    (assistant `function_call`/`tool_calls`) and its `function`/`tool`
    results are never separated and no orphaned tool result is left at the
    head of the retained history (strict providers reject that with a 400).
    Allowing plain-assistant boundaries (not just `user` ones) stops a long
    tail of reasoning/function messages from wasting the whole retention
    budget.  The newest user message — the current prompt — is always kept.

    When messages are dropped, a single placeholder `user` message is inserted
    right after the system prompt: "[… N messages omitted from A to B to fit
    context window …]".  The count grows and the trailing timestamp advances on
    each later truncation while the leading timestamp stays fixed, so the model
    knows the history is incomplete and doesn't reason about missing material.
    A `user` role is used (matching the codebase's SYSTEM ALERT convention and
    the guidance for strict-alternation providers, which reject a second
    `system` message) and the real system prompt is left byte-identical so it
    stays cacheable.

    `messages` must NOT include the system message (it is passed separately
    as `system_message`).  Returns the full message list with the system
    message prepended, matching the contract of tokentrim.trim.

    References:
    - https://github.com/character-ai/prompt-poet#cache-aware-truncation-explained
